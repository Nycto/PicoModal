Example Code
------------

If all you want to do is display a modal, it's as easy as
this: ([Run this code](http://jsfiddle.net/z2t9e/))

```javascript
  picoModal("Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots.");
```

For more control over the behaviour of the modal, you can pass in a
settings object: ([Run this code](http://jsfiddle.net/BqHeY/))

```javascript
  picoModal({
      content: "Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots.",
      overlayStyles: {
          backgroundColor: "#169",
          opacity: 0.75
      }
  });
```

A full list of settings is documented below.

If you need to be able to programatically close the modal you can do it like
this: ([Run this code](http://jsfiddle.net/8pPTD/))

```javascript
  var modal = picoModal(
      "<p>Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots.<p>"
      + "<p><a href='#' class='dismiss'>Dismiss</a></p>"
  );

  document.getElementsByClassName("dismiss")[0].onclick = function () {
      modal.close();
  };
```

You can also attach an event to fire when the modal is closed:
([Run this code](http://jsfiddle.net/TM95X/))

```javascript
  var modal = picoModal(
      "Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots."
  );

  modal.onClose(function () {
      alert("Closed");
  });
```

To disable the close button, and instead just rely on someone clicking
outside of the modal, you can do this:
([Run this code](http://jsfiddle.net/dwhcX/))

```javascript
  picoModal({
      content: "Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots.",
      closeButton: false
  });
```

Or, to disable closing when someone clicks outside of the modal, you can
do this: ([Run this code](http://jsfiddle.net/WkG3d/))

```javascript
  picoModal({
      content: "Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots.",
      overlayClose: false
  });
```

Or, to add a custom close button do this:

```javascript
  picoModal({
      content: "Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots.",
      closeButtonCustom: "<span>Close Modal</span>"
  });
```
